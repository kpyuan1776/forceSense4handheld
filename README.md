## installation and getting started
  * get arduino environment (here at least Arduino 1.6.9)
  * Processing (here at least Processing 2.2.1)
  * arduino uno
  * update COM port in Processing readDisplForce.pde (I programmed it for windows so COM3 is used)
  * upload arduino program to arduino uno
  * start readDisplForce
  * the two buttons at the bottom can start or stop a recording
